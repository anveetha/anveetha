# 👋 Hi, My name is Anveetha!

🎓 The University of Texas at Dallas  
📚 Studying Data Science, minors in Cognitive Science and Finance  
💡 Interest in Data Science, Machine Learning, Statistical Modeling, Cognitive and Neural Modeling  

I'm passionate about applying data science and machine learning to real-world problems—especially at the intersection of human behavior and AI. Currently exploring statistical ML, cognitive modeling, and the power of data-driven solutions across domains like healthcare, finance, and tech.  

As President of the Artificial Intelligence Society at UTD, I lead 400+ members and organize HackAI—one of the largest student-led AI hackathons in the U.S. I'm also a Machine Learning Fellow at Break Through Tech, where I work on projects promoting AI equity and accessibility.  

Always open to collaborating, building, and learning something new. Let’s connect!

## ✨ Fun Facts
You'll typically find me with some form of caffeine in my hand and headphones on -- I love making coffee and listening to the biggest variety of music out there!
Not only that, I love exploring about machine learnining and statistical methods as well as the ethics of AI. 
I'm currently reading Algorithnms for Life by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths!
